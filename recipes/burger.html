    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A burger, or hamburger, is a dish consisting of a cooked patty of ground meat or 
        other savory ingredients, served in a sliced bun or roll. While the term "hamburger" 
        historically implied a beef patty, "burger" is now a broader term for a wide range of
        patties made from ingredients like chicken, fish, vegetables, and plant-based alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Burgers are often garnished with toppings such as cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion, and 
        are typically accompanied by condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>Toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles</li>
        <li>Sauces: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <li>
            Prepare the patties: Gently mix the beef, salt, pepper, and garlic in a bowl, being careful 
            not to overmix, which can make the burgers tough. Form the mixture into four equal patties, 
            about 2 cm thick. Press a small dimple into the center of each patty with your thumb to help 
            it cook evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the burgers: Heat the oil or butter in a pan or grill over medium-high heat. Cook the 
            patties for 3-4 minutes per side for medium doneness. For a cheeseburger, add a slice of 
            cheese in the last minute of cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toast the buns: Lightly toast the buns on the pan or grill.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble and serve: Spread your preferred sauces on the buns. Layer with the burger patty 
            and toppings.
        </li>
    </ol>
