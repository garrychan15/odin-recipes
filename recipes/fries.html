    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        French fries are long, thin pieces of potato that have been deep-fried to a 
        golden-brown crisp, typically served hot. A beloved side dish and snack worldwide, 
        they are known for their combination of a crunchy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. 
        The cut and preparation can vary, creating different styles like shoestring, crinkle-cut, 
        or steak fries. They are commonly seasoned with salt and served with condiments like ketchup, 
        mayonnaise, or vinegar.

    <p>
        While the exact origin is debated, with both Belgium and France having strong claims, the 
        widespread popularity of French fries was cemented by the rise of fast-food chains.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Canola oil, or other high-smoke-point oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Salt, for seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the potatoes: Peel the potatoes and cut them into even-sized sticks, 
            about 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Soak the potatoes: Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and let them 
            soak for at least 30 minutes, which helps remove excess starch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dry the potatoes: Drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry with a clean kitchen 
            towel or paper towels. Excess moisture will cause oil to splatter and create soggy fries.
        </li>
        <li>
            First fry (blanch): Heat oil in a large pot to 325째F (160째C). Fry the potatoes in batches 
            for 4-6 minutes, or until they are soft but not yet browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cool the fries: Remove the blanched fries from the oil and spread them on a wire rack or 
            baking sheet to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Second fry: Increase the oil temperature to 375째F (190째C). Fry the cooled potatoes again 
            for 2-4 minutes until they are golden brown and crispy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season and serve: Remove the fries from the oil, drain on paper towels, and season 
            immediately with salt while they are still hot. 
        </li>
    </ol>
